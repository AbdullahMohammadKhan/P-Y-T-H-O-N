How to print without newline in Python?
Generally people switching from C/C++ to Python wonder how to print two or more variables or statements without going into a new line in python. Since the python print() function by default ends with newline. Python has a predefined format if you use print(a_variable) then it will go to next line automatically.
For examples:



print("geeks") 
print("geeksforgeeks") 
will result into this

geeks
geeksforgeeks
But sometime it may happen that we donâ€™t want to go to next line but want to print on the same line. So what we can do?
For Example:

Input : print("geeks") print("geeksforgeeks")
Output : geeks geeksforgeeks

Input : a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output : 1 2 3 4 
The solution discussed here is totally dependent on the python version you are using.

Print without newline in Python 2.x


# Python 2 code for printing 
# on the same line printing 
# geeks and geeksforgeeks  
# in the same line 
  
print("geeks"), 
print("geeksforgeeks") 
  
# array 
a = [1, 2, 3, 4] 
  
# printing a element in same 
# line 
for i in range(4): 
    print(a[i]),  
Output:

geeks geeksforgeeks
1 2 3 4
Print without newline in Python 3.x


# Python 3 code for printing 
# on the same line printing  
# geeks and geeksforgeeks  
# in the same line 
  
print("geeks", end =" ") 
print("geeksforgeeks") 
  
# array 
a = [1, 2, 3, 4] 
  
# printing a element in same 
# line 
for i in range(4): 
    print(a[i], end =" ")  
Output:

geeks geeksforgeeks
1 2 3 4




This simple example will print 1-10 on the same line.

for i in range(1,11):
    print (i, end=" ")
